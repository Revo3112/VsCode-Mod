User Experience Flow (Step-by-Step Implementation):You must implement the following animated user flow precisely.Step A: The Entry ScreenA minimal initial screen showing only the full-page background.In the center, a single, elegantly animated button or text appears, saying: "Klik di sini".Step B: The Birthday Greeting ScreenTrigger: Activates upon the user's click from Step A.Animation: As the new screen fades in, trigger a full-screen, professional-looking confetti animation using react-confetti.
Content: Prominently display the text: Heading: "Happy Birthday, Azka Rahilla Hardi!" Sub-heading: "Selamat ulang tahun yang ke-21, semoga semua impianmu terwujud." Next Action: Include a button that says "Lihat Video Spesial Ini".
Step C: The Video Player Screen Trigger: Activates after the user clicks the button from Step B.
Functionality: Display an embedded YouTube video player.
Use this exact placeholder URL (make it easily replaceable in the code):  (placeholder, user will provide final).
You must detect when the video finishes playing. Upon completion, automatically and smoothly transition to the final screen (Step D). Use a library like react-youtube to manage events.Step D: Final Animation
 Trigger: Activates automatically after the video ends.Animation: This is the emotional climax. The screen should fade to a soft color from the palette. Then, display a beautifully animated message "I love you" accompanied by a large, animated heart (e.g., a beating or forming heart SVG). This is the final state of the website.
Final Polish:
All transitions between steps must be fluid and elegant (e.g., fade-in/out, subtle slides). The user experience should feel premium and seamless.The website must be fully responsive for both desktop and mobile views. Deployment: Test the entire user flow to ensure all animations and triggers work flawlessly. Deploy the final, tested application to a platform like Vercel or Netlify. Final Deliverable: A public URL to the fully functional, beautiful, and bug-free birthday website.
